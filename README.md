# Healthcare_Financial_Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing hospital financial data, providing insights into revenue generation across various departments, procedures, and patient costs, including insurance and self-pay contributions.

This Power BI project is designed to provide comprehensive financial insights for a healthcare organization, focusing on hospital revenue, cost management, and billing breakdowns. Using a combination of DAX calculations and interactive visuals, the project aims to deliver actionable insights into the hospital's financial health and facilitate better decision-making for resource allocation and operational efficiency.

Data Transformation and Modeling:
The project begins with data extraction and transformation from various sources like patient billing, treatment records, insurance claims, and room charges.
Using Power Query, we clean, normalize, and integrate the data, ensuring it is ready for analysis. Key relationships between different datasets (e.g., procedures, services, diagnosis types) are established to enable seamless analysis across different aspects of hospital billing.

Extensive Use of DAX Measures:
Revenue Calculations: DAX is used extensively to create dynamic measures that calculate total revenue from patient treatments, insurance payments, and out-of-pocket costs. These include measures like:
Total Revenue from treatments, procedural revenue, insurance contributions, and self-pay revenues.
Average Treatment Cost and Average Room Charge, helping to understand cost-per-patient and room utilization.
Cost Analysis: Specific DAX measures were built to calculate treatment costs, medication costs, and room charges. These measures allow for a detailed cost breakdown to understand better where hospital funds are being allocated. Measures like Total Medication Costs and Total Treatment Costs were calculated, providing a clear financial picture of the hospital's operations.

Interactive Visuals:
Various visuals are created to present the data in a user-friendly manner. These visuals aim to provide a deeper understanding of the hospitalâ€™s financial performance by breaking down billing information across multiple categories, such as:
Billing by UK Locations: Visualizing revenue and costs at a geographical level, enabling hospital administrators to track financial performance across different regions or locations.
Revenue by Procedure: A breakdown of earnings per medical procedure, providing insights into which services are most profitable and which treatments generate the most revenue.
Billing by Service Type: A visual representation of how different service types (e.g., emergency, surgery, outpatient) contribute to total revenue.
Diagnosis-Based Billing: Visuals that show the financial impact of different diagnoses, allowing the hospital to assess the costs and revenue associated with various health conditions treated within the institution.
